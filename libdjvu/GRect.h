/** @name Point Coordinates vs. Pixel Coordinates

    The DjVu technology relies on the accurate superposition of images at
    different resolutions.  Such an accuracy cannot be reached with the usual
    assumption that pixels are small enough to be considered infinitesimally
    small.  We must distinguish very precisely ``points'' and ``pixels''.
    This distinction is essential for performing scaling operations.

    The pixels of an image are identified by ``pixel coordinates''.  The
    bottom-left corner pixel has coordinates #(0,0)# and the top-right corner
    pixel has coordinates #(w-1,h-1)# where #w# and #h# are the image size.
    Pixel coordinates are necessarily integers since pixels never overlap.

    An infinitesimally small point is identified by its ``point coordinates''.
    There may be fractional point coordinates, although this library does not
    make use of them.  Points with integer coordinates are located {\em on the
    corners of each pixel}.  They are not located on the pixel centers.  The
    center of the pixel with pixel coordinates #(i,j)# is located at point
    coordinates #(i+1/2,j+1/2)#.  In other words, the pixel #(i,j)# extends
    from point #(i,j)# to point #(i+1,j+1)#.

    Therefore, the point located on the bottom left corner of an image has
    coordinates #(0,0)#.  This point is in fact the bottom left corner of the
    bottom left pixel of the image.  The point located on the top right corner
    of an image has coordinates #(w,h)# where #w# and #h# are the image size.
    This is in fact the top right corner of pixel #(w-1,h-1)# which is the
    image pixel with the highest coordinates.
